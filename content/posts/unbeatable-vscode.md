I've been working on my terminal-only development environment for about 1-2 years already, and for this time I established some common tools that I use on a daily basis, among these are Helix editor, Zellij, lazygit, and a bunch of others. These tool are 99% keyboard driven, and in order to work with them you have to know a bunch of keybindings, each having their own ones, but there's no need to say that it makes you quite more efficient. I consider myself as an above average level Vim/Helix movement user.

In particularly stressful situations where you need to act fast (an example would be a production hotfix), I very often find myself having my head completely empty. Like your muscle memory just gets wiped out in a moment and you don't know how to do even some basic things. 

 The problem is that when I get into such stressful situations, I just forget the simplest movements and keymaps. Probably I'm having troubles with stress management, but still that's a problem when you need to solve a problem quickly, and you are convinced that the bug is user-facing or it makes the client lose money. What struck me recently is that to use VS Code you must know nearly 0 keymaps or shortcuts. It's visual accessibility makes it a very good match for me in such situations. You just click your mouse on things you see and it's all good. Having said that, this makes VS Code a perfect fit for me in such situations.
