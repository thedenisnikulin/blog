      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my terminal-only development environment for about 1-2 years already, and for this time I established some common tools that I use on a daily basis, among these are Helix editor, Zellij, lazygit, and a bunch of others. These tool are 99% keyboard driven, and in order to work with them you have to know a bunch of keybindings, each having their own ones, but there&amp;rsquo;s no need to say that it makes you quite more efficient.</description>

      <title>My Approach to Neovim</title>

      <description>The story I always found myself looking towards those terminal based modal editors like Neovim, but every time one thing really held me behind: the amount of time I needed to put into configuration. You have to spend quite a lot of time to configure a stable feature-complete version of Neovim, and it actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite pay off in the beginning, because it&amp;rsquo;s so tempting to stay with your comfy VS Code and don&amp;rsquo;t waste time.</description>
